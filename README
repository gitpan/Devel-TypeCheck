Devel-TypeCheck v0.01

The TypeCheck program uses static analysis to infer types for
expressions and variables.  An error is reported if the type use is
inconsistent.  For instance, it will report when a reference is used
where a string or number is expected, and vice versa.

This program relies on the B compiler back end (which is included with
Perl).  It has only been tested with Perl 5.8.1.

To run, invoke as one would normally do with a compiler back end
module.  The following example type checks the main block of
PROGRAM.pl and prints out the operand tree while it runs:

perl -MO=TypeCheck,-main,-verbose PROGRAM.pl

For more information, see Devel::TypeCheck(3).
